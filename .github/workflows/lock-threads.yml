# Automated Thread Locking for Inactive Issues and PRs
#
# Purpose: Prevents necroposting on old, closed issues and PRs by automatically
#          locking them after a period of inactivity. This helps maintain
#          discussion quality and encourages opening new issues for new problems.
#
# Triggers:
#   - Scheduled: Daily at 2am UTC
#   - Manual: Via workflow_dispatch
#
# Behavior:
#   - Issues: Locked 90 days after closing
#   - PRs: Locked 60 days after closing
#   - Only processes closed items
#   - Adds explanatory comment before locking
#   - Respects exemption labels
#
# Exemptions:
#   - Issues with: keep-open, pinned, security labels
#   - PRs with: keep-open, pinned labels
