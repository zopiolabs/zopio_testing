# Continuous Integration Pipeline
#
# Purpose: Fast CI workflow for develop and staging branches focusing on
#          code quality and test coverage.
#
# Triggers:
#   - Push to: develop, staging branches
#   - PRs to: develop, staging, release/*, version branches
#
# Jobs:
#   1. Lint: Code quality checks with Biome
#   2. Test: Run test suite with Vitest
#   3. Build: Verify successful compilation
#
# Features:
#   - Parallel job execution for speed
#   - Graceful handling of missing scripts
#   - Frozen lockfile for reproducible builds
#   - Concurrency control to cancel outdated runs
