# Rule Structure

Trigger rules follow a specific JSON structure that defines when and how they should be applied. This page explains the structure of rules and how to create them.

## Basic Rule Structure

A rule consists of the following components:

```typescript
interface JSONRule {
  id: string;              // Unique identifier for the rule
  name: string;            // Human-readable name
  description?: string;    // Optional description
  event: string;           // Event type this rule applies to (e.g., "user.created")
  condition: Condition;    // Conditions that must be met for the rule to trigger
  actions: Action[];       // Actions to perform when the rule is triggered
  priority?: number;       // Optional priority (higher numbers = higher priority)
  enabled?: boolean;       // Whether the rule is enabled (defaults to true)
  tags?: string[];         // Optional tags for categorizing rules
}
```

## Example Rule

Here's an example of a complete rule:

```json
{
  "id": "premium-user-welcome",
  "name": "Premium User Welcome",
  "description": "Send a special welcome email to premium users",
  "event": "user.created",
  "condition": {
    "operator": "AND",
    "conditions": [
      {
        "field": "user.plan",
        "operator": "equals",
        "value": "premium"
      },
      {
        "field": "user.email",
        "operator": "exists"
      }
    ]
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "email",
      "template": "premium-welcome",
      "recipient": "{{user.email}}",
      "data": {
        "userName": "{{user.name}}"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "notification",
      "target": "sales",
      "message": "New premium user: {{user.email}}"
    }
  ],
  "priority": 10,
  "enabled": true,
  "tags": ["premium", "onboarding"]
}
```

## Rule Components

### ID and Name

Each rule must have a unique `id` and a human-readable `name`:

```json
{
  "id": "new-user-notification",
  "name": "New User Notification"
}
```

### Event Type

The `event` field specifies which event type this rule applies to:

```json
{
  "event": "user.created"
}
```

Common event types include:
- `user.created`
- `user.updated`
- `user.deleted`
- `payment.succeeded`
- `document.shared`

### Conditions

The `condition` field defines when the rule should be triggered. It can be a simple condition or a complex nested structure:

```json
{
  "condition": {
    "operator": "AND",
    "conditions": [
      {
        "field": "user.email",
        "operator": "contains",
        "value": "@example.com"
      },
      {
        "field": "user.role",
        "operator": "equals",
        "value": "admin"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

See the [Conditions](/packages/trigger-rules/conditions) page for more details on available operators and condition types.

### Actions

The `actions` field is an array of actions to perform when the rule is triggered:

```json
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "email",
      "template": "welcome-email",
      "recipient": "{{user.email}}"
    },
    {
      "type": "webhook",
      "url": "https://example.com/webhook",
      "method": "POST",
      "payload": {
        "userId": "{{user.id}}",
        "event": "user_created"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

See the [Actions](/packages/trigger-rules/actions) page for more details on available action types.

### Priority

The optional `priority` field determines the order in which rules are evaluated when multiple rules match the same event:

```json
{
  "priority": 10  // Higher numbers = higher priority
}
```

### Enabled Flag

The optional `enabled` field determines whether the rule is active:

```json
{
  "enabled": true  // Defaults to true if not specified
}
```

### Tags

The optional `tags` field allows you to categorize rules:

```json
{
  "tags": ["onboarding", "email", "premium"]
}
```

## Rule Organization

Rules can be organized in different ways:

### Single JSON File

Store all rules in a single JSON file:

```json
// rules.json
[
  {
    "id": "rule1",
    "name": "Rule 1",
    // ...
  },
  {
    "id": "rule2",
    "name": "Rule 2",
    // ...
  }
]
```

### Multiple Files by Category

Organize rules into separate files by category:

```
rules/
  user-rules.json
  payment-rules.json
  notification-rules.json
```

### Database Storage

For more dynamic applications, rules can be stored in a database and loaded at runtime.

## Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive IDs and names** - Make it easy to understand what each rule does
2. **Keep conditions focused** - Don't create overly complex conditions
3. **Use tags for organization** - Tags make it easier to filter and manage rules
4. **Set appropriate priorities** - Use priorities to ensure rules are evaluated in the correct order
5. **Document your rules** - Add descriptions to explain the purpose of each rule
