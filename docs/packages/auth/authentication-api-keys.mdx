# Programmatic Access to Your Application

API keys provide a secure way to authenticate programmatic access to your application's resources. The `zopio` framework includes a comprehensive API key management system integrated with [Clerk](https://clerk.com/).

## Overview

The API key system in `zopio` is built on top of Clerk's API key functionality and consists of:

- A core package (`@repo/api-key`) that handles API key creation and validation
- API endpoints for managing API keys
- Authentication middleware for protecting routes with API key authentication

## Core Package

The `@repo/api-key` package provides the fundamental API key functionality:

```typescript
// Create a new API key
import { createApiKey } from '@repo/api-key/lib/clerk-adapter'

const apiKey = await createApiKey(
  userId,    // The user ID to associate with the key
  name,      // A descriptive name for the key
  scopes,    // Array of permission scopes
  expiration // Expiration date for the key
)

// Validate an API key
import { validateApiKey } from '@repo/api-key/lib/validate'

const userId = await validateApiKey(apiKeyString)
```

## API Endpoints

The framework provides RESTful endpoints for API key management in the `api` app:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api-keys` | GET | List all API keys for the authenticated user |
| `/api-keys` | POST | Create a new API key |
| `/api-keys` | DELETE | Delete an API key by ID |

These endpoints are protected by the API key authentication middleware, ensuring that only authorized users can manage API keys.

## Authentication Middleware

The `apiKeyAuthMiddleware` function provides a simple way to protect routes with API key authentication:

```typescript
import { apiKeyAuthMiddleware } from '@repo/auth/apiKeyAuthMiddleware'

export async function GET(req: Request) {
  const validatedReq = await apiKeyAuthMiddleware(req)
  
  // If authentication fails, validatedReq will be a Response object
  if (validatedReq instanceof Response) return validatedReq
  
  // Authentication succeeded, validatedReq.user contains the user ID
  const userId = validatedReq.user.id
  
  // Process the authenticated request
  // ...
}
```

## Creating API Keys

To create a new API key, make a POST request to the `/api-keys` endpoint with the following payload:

```json
{
  "userId": "user_123",
  "name": "My API Key",
  "scopes": ["read:data", "write:data"],
  "expiration": "2024-12-31"
}
```

The response will include the API key details, including the secret key that should be securely stored by the client.

## Using API Keys

To use an API key in API requests, include it in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here
```

## Security Considerations

- API keys should be treated as sensitive credentials and never exposed in client-side code
- Use HTTPS for all API requests to prevent key interception
- Assign the minimum necessary permissions to each API key
- Implement key rotation policies for long-lived API keys
- Monitor API key usage for suspicious activity

## Implementation Details

The API key system is implemented with a clean separation of concerns:

1. **Core Package**: Handles the fundamental operations of creating and validating API keys
2. **API Layer**: Exposes endpoints for managing API keys
3. **Authentication Middleware**: Protects routes with API key authentication

This architecture ensures that the API key system is modular, maintainable, and secure.

## Example: Protected Endpoint

Here's an example of a protected endpoint that requires API key authentication:

```typescript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { apiKeyAuthMiddleware } from '@repo/auth/apiKeyAuthMiddleware'

export async function GET(req: NextRequest) {
  const validatedReq = await apiKeyAuthMiddleware(req)
  
  if (validatedReq instanceof Response) {
    return validatedReq // Return the error response
  }

  // The request is authenticated, process it
  const userId = validatedReq.user.id
  
  return NextResponse.json({
    message: 'API key authentication successful',
    user: userId,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  })
}
```

This endpoint will return a 401 Unauthorized response if no API key is provided, a 403 Forbidden response if an invalid API key is provided, and a 200 OK response with the user ID if a valid API key is provided.
