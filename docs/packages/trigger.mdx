# Event-Driven Workflows and Background Jobs

The `@repo/trigger` package provides a seamless integration with [Trigger.dev](https://trigger.dev), a powerful platform for running background jobs and event-driven workflows in your Next.js application.

## Features

- Pre-configured Trigger.dev client with proper environment variable handling
- Type-safe event sending with error handling
- Organized job structure for better maintainability
- Seamless integration with the API app

## Installation

This package is part of the `zopio` monorepo and is available to all applications in the workspace.

```bash
# If you're adding it to a new package in the monorepo
pnpm add @repo/trigger
```

## Environment Variables

The package requires the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TRIGGER_API_KEY` | Your Trigger.dev API key | Yes |
| `TRIGGER_API_URL` | The Trigger.dev API URL | No (defaults to "https://api.trigger.dev") |

## Basic Usage

### Importing the Client

```typescript
import { client } from "@repo/trigger";
```

### Defining a Job

Jobs are defined using the Trigger.dev client. Here's an example of a simple job:

```typescript
import { client } from "@repo/trigger";
import { eventTrigger, type IO } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";

// Define the payload type for type safety
interface UserCreatedPayload {
  email: string;
  name?: string;
}

// Define the job
export const sendWelcomeEmailJob = client.defineJob({
  id: "send-welcome-email",
  name: "Send Welcome Email",
  version: "1.0.0",
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "user.created",
  }),
  run: async (payload: UserCreatedPayload, io: IO) => {
    await io.logger.info(`Sending welcome email to ${payload.email}`);
    // Your job logic here
    return { success: true };
  },
});
```

### Sending Events

To trigger a job, you need to send an event with the corresponding name:

```typescript
import { sendEvent } from "@repo/trigger";

// Send an event to trigger a job
await sendEvent("user.created", {
  email: "user@example.com",
  name: "John Doe"
});
```

## Integration with API

The trigger package is integrated with the API app to provide a webhook endpoint for Trigger.dev.

### API Route Handler

The API app includes a route handler at `app/trigger/route.ts` that processes incoming webhook requests:

```typescript
// app/trigger/route.ts
import type { NextRequest } from "next/server";
import { sendEvent } from "@repo/trigger";

// Import all job definitions
import "./jobs/index.js";

export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const body = await req.json();
    
    if (!body || !body.event) {
      return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: "Missing required fields" }), { 
        status: 400,
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }
      });
    }

    const { event, payload } = body;
    const result = await sendEvent(event, payload);

    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ 
      success: true, 
      message: `Event ${event} sent to Trigger.dev`,
      result
    }), { 
      status: 200,
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error processing trigger event:", error);
    
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ 
      error: "Failed to process event",
      message: error instanceof Error ? error.message : "Unknown error"
    }), { 
      status: 500,
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }
    });
  }
}
```

### Job Organization

Jobs are organized in a dedicated directory structure:

```
app/
  trigger/
    jobs/
      index.ts     # Exports all job definitions
      user-jobs.ts # User-related jobs
      # Add more job files as needed
    route.ts       # API route handler
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Job Triggers

Besides event triggers, Trigger.dev supports various other trigger types:

```typescript
import { client } from "@repo/trigger";
import { scheduleEvent } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";

// Create a scheduled job
export const dailyReportJob = client.defineJob({
  id: "daily-report",
  name: "Generate Daily Report",
  version: "1.0.0",
  trigger: scheduleEvent({
    cron: "0 9 * * *", // Run at 9 AM every day
  }),
  run: async (payload, io) => {
    await io.logger.info("Generating daily report");
    // Generate and send report
    return { success: true };
  },
});
```

### Job Dependencies

You can define jobs that depend on other services:

```typescript
import { client } from "@repo/trigger";
import { eventTrigger } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { slack } from "@trigger.dev/slack";

// Create a job with Slack integration
const slackIntegration = slack.create();

export const notifySlackJob = client.defineJob({
  id: "notify-slack",
  name: "Notify Slack Channel",
  version: "1.0.0",
  integrations: {
    slack: slackIntegration,
  },
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "important.event",
  }),
  run: async (payload, io) => {
    await io.slack.postMessage("Notification", {
      channel: "alerts",
      text: `Important event: ${payload.message}`,
    });
    return { success: true };
  },
});
```

## Error Handling

The `sendEvent` function includes built-in error handling:

```typescript
import { sendEvent } from "@repo/trigger";

try {
  await sendEvent("user.created", { email: "user@example.com" });
  console.log("Event sent successfully");
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Failed to send event:", error);
  // Handle the error appropriately
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Missing API Key

If you see a warning about a missing API key, make sure to set the `TRIGGER_API_KEY` environment variable:

<Info>
TRIGGER_API_KEY=missing-api-key environment variable is not set. Trigger.dev functionality will not work properly.
</Info>

### Job Not Running

If your job isn't running when you send an event, check the following:

1. Make sure the event name matches exactly
2. Verify that your job is properly imported and registered
3. Check the Trigger.dev dashboard for any errors
