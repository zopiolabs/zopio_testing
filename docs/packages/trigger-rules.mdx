# Trigger Rules

The `@repo/trigger-rules` package provides a powerful rule engine for processing events in your Trigger.dev workflows. It allows you to define JSON-based rules that can be evaluated against event payloads to determine actions and routing.

## Features

- JSON-based rule definitions for easy configuration
- Condition evaluation with support for complex expressions
- Integration with Trigger.dev jobs and events
- Dynamic rule loading and evaluation
- Support for internationalization

## Installation

This package is part of the `zopio` monorepo and is available to all applications in the workspace.

```bash
pnpm add @repo/trigger-rules
```

## Basic Usage

### Importing the Rule Engine

```typescript
import { evaluateRule, type JSONRule } from "@repo/trigger-rules";
```

### Defining Rules

Rules are defined in JSON format, either inline or loaded from a file:

```typescript
// Define a rule inline
const rule: JSONRule = {
  id: "new-user-notification",
  name: "New User Notification",
  description: "Send notification when a new user signs up",
  event: "user.created",
  condition: {
    operator: "AND",
    conditions: [
      {
        field: "user.email",
        operator: "contains",
        value: "@example.com"
      }
    ]
  },
  actions: [
    {
      type: "notification",
      target: "admin",
      template: "new-user"
    }
  ]
};

// Or load rules from a JSON file
import rules from "./rules.json";
const typedRules = rules as JSONRule[];
```

### Evaluating Rules

```typescript
// Evaluate a single rule
const result = await evaluateRule(rule, { 
  user: { 
    email: "user@example.com",
    name: "John Doe" 
  } 
});

// Evaluate multiple rules
const matchingRules = typedRules.filter(rule => rule.event === "user.created");
for (const rule of matchingRules) {
  await evaluateRule(rule, { user: payload });
}
```

## Integration with Trigger.dev

The trigger rules package integrates seamlessly with Trigger.dev jobs:

```typescript
import { client } from "@repo/trigger";
import { eventTrigger, type IO } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { evaluateRule, type JSONRule } from "@repo/trigger-rules";
import rules from "../rules.json";

const typedRules = rules as JSONRule[];

export const userCreatedJob = client.defineJob({
  id: "process-user-created",
  name: "Process User Created",
  version: "1.0.0",
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "user.created",
  }),
  run: async (payload, io) => {
    // Log the event
    await io.logger.info(`New user created: ${payload.email}`);
    
    // Find and evaluate matching rules
    const matchingRules = typedRules.filter(rule => rule.event === "user.created");
    
    for (const rule of matchingRules) {
      await evaluateRule(rule, { user: payload });
    }
    
    return { success: true };
  },
});
```
