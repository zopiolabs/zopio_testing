# Creating and Managing Jobs

Jobs are the core building blocks of the Trigger.dev integration. This guide explains how to create, organize, and manage jobs in your `zopio` application.

## Job Structure

In the `zopio` framework, jobs are organized in a dedicated directory structure:

```
app/
  trigger/
    jobs/
      index.ts     # Exports all job definitions
      user-jobs.ts # User-related jobs
      # Add more job files as needed
    route.ts       # API route handler
```

## Creating a Job

To create a new job, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file in the `app/trigger/jobs` directory or add to an existing file
2. Import the necessary dependencies
3. Define your job using the Trigger.dev client

Here's an example of a basic job:

```typescript
import { client } from "@repo/trigger";
import { eventTrigger, type IO } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";

// Define the payload type for type safety
interface EmailPayload {
  to: string;
  subject: string;
  body: string;
}

// Define the job
export const sendEmailJob = client.defineJob({
  id: "send-email",
  name: "Send Email",
  version: "1.0.0",
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "email.send",
  }),
  run: async (payload: EmailPayload, io: IO) => {
    await io.logger.info(`Sending email to ${payload.to}`);
    
    // Your email sending logic here
    // Example: await emailService.send(payload);
    
    return { success: true, to: payload.to };
  },
});
```

## Job Types

Trigger.dev supports various types of jobs:

### Event-Triggered Jobs

Jobs that run in response to specific events:

```typescript
import { eventTrigger } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";

export const eventJob = client.defineJob({
  id: "event-job",
  name: "Event Job",
  version: "1.0.0",
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "custom.event",
  }),
  run: async (payload, io) => {
    // Job logic
  },
});
```

### Scheduled Jobs

Jobs that run on a schedule:

```typescript
import { scheduleEvent } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";

export const scheduledJob = client.defineJob({
  id: "scheduled-job",
  name: "Scheduled Job",
  version: "1.0.0",
  trigger: scheduleEvent({
    cron: "0 9 * * *", // Run at 9 AM every day
  }),
  run: async (payload, io) => {
    // Job logic
  },
});
```

### Webhook-Triggered Jobs

Jobs that run in response to external webhooks:

```typescript
import { webhookEvent } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";

export const webhookJob = client.defineJob({
  id: "webhook-job",
  name: "Webhook Job",
  version: "1.0.0",
  trigger: webhookEvent({
    source: "stripe",
    event: "payment.succeeded",
  }),
  run: async (payload, io) => {
    // Job logic
  },
});
```

## Job Versioning

When updating a job, it's important to increment the version number to ensure proper handling of in-flight jobs:

```typescript
export const myJob = client.defineJob({
  id: "my-job",
  name: "My Job",
  version: "1.0.1", // Increment this when making changes
  // ...
});
```

## Job Organization

For larger applications, it's recommended to organize jobs by domain:

- `user-jobs.ts` - Jobs related to user management
- `payment-jobs.ts` - Jobs related to payments
- `notification-jobs.ts` - Jobs related to notifications

Make sure to export all job files from the `index.ts` file:

```typescript
// jobs/index.ts
export * from './user-jobs.js';
export * from './payment-jobs.js';
export * from './notification-jobs.js';
```

## Job Dependencies

Jobs can depend on external services or integrations:

```typescript
import { slack } from "@trigger.dev/slack";

const slackIntegration = slack.create();

export const slackNotificationJob = client.defineJob({
  id: "slack-notification",
  name: "Slack Notification",
  version: "1.0.0",
  integrations: {
    slack: slackIntegration,
  },
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "notification.send",
  }),
  run: async (payload, io) => {
    await io.slack.postMessage("notification", {
      channel: payload.channel,
      text: payload.message,
    });
    return { success: true };
  },
});
```

## Testing Jobs

To test a job, you can send an event that triggers it:

```typescript
import { sendEvent } from "@repo/trigger";

// In a test or development environment
await sendEvent("email.send", {
  to: "test@example.com",
  subject: "Test Email",
  body: "This is a test email"
});
```

## Job Monitoring

You can monitor your jobs in the Trigger.dev dashboard, which provides:

- Real-time job execution status
- Detailed logs for each run
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking
